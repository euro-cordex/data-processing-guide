No such evidence emerged, but the e-mails did reveal another problem — one described by a {CRU} employee named  ” Harry”, who often wrote of his wrestling matches with wonky computer software.},

I am a professional software engineer and I want to share a trade secret with scientists: most professional computer software isn't very good. The code inside your laptop, television, phone or car is often badly documented, inconsistent and poorly tested.},
