# **Data Processing Guide**

[![pipeline status](http://git.gerics.de/data-processing/DataProcessingGuide/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](http://git.gerics.de/data-processing/DataProcessingGuide/commits/master)

The data processing guide is now using [sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html).
If you want to build the documentation, you can choose between `html` or `pdf`, using:

```
make html
make latexpdf
```

For a compiled html version, see here: http://136.172.63.17/DataProcessingGuide

For the source files, go here: https://git.gerics.de/DataProcessing/DataProcessingGuide

## How to contribute

You are very welcome to contribute your knowledge! The source files can be found in the
`source` directory and edited right into the gitlab. Please note, that we use
now `rst` file format. There is also lots of examples of how to format nicely 
in the [**RST Syntax Examples**](https://git.gerics.de/data-processing/DataProcessingGuide/blob/master/source/syntax-examples.rst) chapter, although it's not important and can be done later.
You can also click on `source` in the compiled html version to see the `rst` source code.
Note, that with `rst` you can also use citing in bibtex style!
