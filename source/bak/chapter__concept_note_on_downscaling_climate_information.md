# **Concept note on Downscaling Climate Information**
*Claas Teichmann, Diana Rechid*

This short concept note describes a common best practice process to obtain, analyze and use climate data. It has of course to be adapted to individual needs and purposes, but can serve as a general guidance. The following steps are examples with short descriptions of how to proceed.

 1. Assessment of available climate information (simulations and observations)
    a. Literature review of available articles and regional studies
    a. Review of available data in publicly accessible databases (e.g., ESGF, etc.)
    a. Review of available data in global and regional modelling and observation communities
    a. Identification of local climate and impact communities and users for information and knowledge exchange

 1. Analysis of available data
    a. Obtaining and storing available data in local IT facilities to be able to analyse the data according to regional and local needs.
    a. Obtaining the tools and capabilities to use them to process and analyse the data
    a. Analysis of the limits of available data with respect to temporal and spatial scales and the processes that are resolved
 1. Assessment of regional requirements
    a. Which processes and impacts related to climate information are important
    a. Which climate data is needed (in addition to what is already available)?
    a. Analysis of historical trends with respect to the regional requirements
 1. Creation of new climate data
    a. In case the available data does not fulfill all identified needs, new climate data has to be created (e.g., at higher temporal and spatial scales).
    a. In case of the need of additional regional climate data, one or more regional models have to be selected.
         i. Assessment of optimal downscaling methodology: dynamical or statistical downscaling
         i. Selection of one or more models
    a. Simulation of past climate: regional model driven by ERA-Interim (a so-called hind-cast)
    a. Evaluation of the regional models by analysing the hind-cast results in comparison with regional to local observation data (on climate time scales)
    a. If the regional climate models fulfills the needs, scenario simulations using different RCPs, driving models and simulations (GCMs, RCMs depending on the target resolution) can be performed to create a small regional ensemble of simulations
    a. Analysis of new regional climate simulations to assess future climate and impacts in the region
    a. Analysis of the limits of newly created simulation data with respect to temporal and spatial scales and the processes that are resolved

## Important things to remember when using climate data
 * Climate models deliver a valuable tool for the assessment of potential future climate change
 * One has to know how to interpret the data of climate models and one has to be careful to not over interpret as climate models (as other models) are suspect to uncertainty
 * Never rely a decision on the output of a single model or emission scenario
 * Build on existing knowledge and expertise
 * Regional expertise is essential
