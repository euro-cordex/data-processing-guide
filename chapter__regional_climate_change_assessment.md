# Climate modelling
## weather vs. Climate

**Weather**
Physical state of the Atmosphere
at a certain place and time. It can be characterised by meteorological parameters, e.g. air pressure, temperature, humidity, precipitation

**Climate**
Climate, sometimes understood as the "average weather,‚Äù is defined as the measurement of the mean and variability of relevant quantities of certain variables (such as temperature, precipitation or wind) over a period of time, ranging from months to thousands or millions of years (Classical time period 30 years)
