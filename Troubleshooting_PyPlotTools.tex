\section{Plotting netcdf file}\label{PyPlotTools}

PyPlotTools are for plotting netcdf output data from RCMs.

First you have to download it from the git:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1. Make a directory PyPlotTools in your home directory or favorite place, where you store your software!

\item cd PyPlotTools

\item git init

\item git pull https://git.gerics.de/PyREMO/PyPlotTools

\item check with: git status
\end{enumerate}

Now you have all python routines and a \textbf{manual pyplottools-1.2.4.pdf}.

There are little things in netcdf files, which can course problemes using the PyPlotTools:

\subsection{pyxy}

\subsubsection{Does not read all files}
If you want to plot multiple files and pyxy does not read all files, check, if
\textbf{all the files have the same file length}.

\subsubsection{The time axis is not displayed in years}
If you excecute:\\

\texttt{pyxy snd png.lgout.scr "snd" xyears yauto 0 0.3 infile}

and \texttt{xyears} does not help to have years (\textit 1996, 1998, 2000) on the x axis, you can apply the following to your netcdf input file:\\

\texttt{cdo -a copy input output}\\

and then try to plot it again.
